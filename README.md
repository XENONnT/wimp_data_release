[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/1078334050.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17381424)

This repository contains the published XENONnT WIMP–nucleon cross-section upper limit data as a function of WIMP mass.

## References

If you use these data, please cite the corresponding publications:

- **SR1:** [arXiv:2502.18005 (2025)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.18005v1)

## Notes

- The power-constrained limit (PCL) threshold was changed to –1σ after SR0.  
- The repository also includes a Jupyter notebook, `plot.ipynb`, which reproduces upper limit plots.
